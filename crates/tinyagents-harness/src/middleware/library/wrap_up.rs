///
/// # Why the loop and not afterwards
///
/// A capped turn used to end like this: the loop exits on the model-call cap,
/// and `OpenHumanSessionHost::summarize_turn_wrapup` then dispatches a second, out-of-band
/// request straight at the `ChatModel` asking for a checkpoint. Being outside
/// the harness, that request ran with **none** of the loop's context
/// management — no microcompact, no compression, no trim — while being built
/// from the largest transcript the turn would ever hold (every tool result a
/// full iteration budget produced). It was therefore the likeliest call of the
/// whole turn to overflow the window, and each of its failure paths returns
/// `("", None)` silently, so the answer degraded to a deterministic digest of
/// tool names exactly when the turn had the most to report. It also bypassed
/// usage accounting (folded back by hand at the call site) and the progress
/// bridge (re-implemented there as buffer-then-validate-then-forward).
///
/// Doing it here removes all of that rather than compensating for it: the
/// concluding call is an ordinary loop iteration, so it inherits the entire
/// middleware stack, its usage rides `UsageCarryMiddleware` like any other
/// call, and its text streams through the normal event bridge. It is also one
/// provider call cheaper — the wrap-up was an extra call *past* the cap the
/// operator configured.
///
/// # What "last permitted call" means, exactly
///
/// The loop records the model call **before** it builds the request
/// (`agent_loop::run_loop`), so by the time `before_model` runs for the Nth
/// call of an N-call budget, `remaining_model_calls()` is already `0`. That is
/// the trigger, and it needs no new plumbing or counter of its own.
///
/// The trade this makes is explicit: a 25-call budget becomes 24 tool rounds
/// plus a conclusion, rather than 25 tool rounds plus a 26th call nobody
/// budgeted for.
///
/// # Why the tools are cleared rather than merely discouraged
///
/// The instruction alone is a request the model may ignore — the out-of-band
/// wrap-up had to re-parse its own response through the dispatcher to catch a
/// model that emitted a tool call anyway. Removing the schemas from the
/// request makes it structural instead: there is nothing to call. `tool_choice`
/// is reset alongside them because a `Required` choice with an empty tool array
/// is a provider 400.
/// The middleware itself. Generic over the run-context payload: nothing here
/// reads it. Configure the deliverable-tool names with
/// [`with_deliverable_tools`](Self::with_deliverable_tools) — the tools left on
/// the belt for the **penultimate** call (see `reserve_final_write`).
///
/// The membership rule is "can only emit, never gather": a tool that writes a
/// file the caller already knows the contents of cannot be spent discovering
/// something the turn then has no room to report, which is what makes reserving
/// the call for them a safe trade rather than a gamble. A shell is deliberately
/// not one — it can equally run a crawler, so keeping it would leave the belt

        // most recent `keep_recent` (5, by default) with `CLEARED_PLACEHOLDER`,
        // and — constructed without a token budget — it does so on every call,
        // not only under context pressure. That is right for an intermediate
        // call, which needs recent context to choose the next tool and nothing
        // more. It is exactly wrong for this one: a turn that spent 24 rounds
        // gathering would be asked to report its findings with 19 rounds of
        // them replaced by "[Old tool result content cleared]", which is the
        // same empty-handed answer this whole mechanism exists to prevent,
        // arrived at from the other direction.
        //
        // Restored from the captured outcomes rather than by exempting the
        // turn from microcompact, because the blanking has already happened by
        // the time this runs (registration order: microcompact is installed by
        // `context_mw.install`, this middleware immediately after it) and
        // because the sink is the honest source — it holds each result as it
        // entered the transcript, after the per-result byte cap.
        //
        // Only a body that IS the placeholder is replaced, so a result the
        // model legitimately saw in full is never rewritten.
        //
        // This deliberately runs BEFORE the compression and trim middlewares,
        // which are installed after it: restoring can make the request large,
        // and those two are what bound it. The resulting degradation ladder is
        // the one this call wants — everything when it fits, an LLM summary of
        // the older slice when it does not, and oldest-first eviction only in
        // extremis. What it never does again is silently blank the middle.
        // Restore newest-first, and only while the request still fits.
        //
        // CodeRabbit on #6068: restoration runs AFTER `ContextCompressionMiddleware`
        // and before `ImageAwareMessageTrimMiddleware`, so an unbounded restore can
        // push the request over the window and the trim then evicts whole
        // messages — which is strictly more destructive than the blanking being
        // undone, and can discard the very results just restored.
        //
        // The review suggested a compression phase after restoration. That is a
        // second summarizer model call on the one call already about to produce
        // the conclusion, and it is avoidable: the overflow is preventable
        // rather than repairable. Restoring under the same budget the trim
        // enforces means the trim never has cause to fire, so nothing is
        // evicted and nothing needs re-summarising.
        //
        // Newest-first because recency is relevance here: the last rounds'
        // results are the ones the model has not seen (the cap is checked
        // before the request is built), and the earliest ones are most likely
        // already reflected in the compression summary above.
